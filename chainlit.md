# EDA Agent

The **EDA Agent** is an intelligent assistant designed to make your process of understanding and analyzing data much easier, faster, and more insightful by allowing you to upload your CSV files directly into this application, where it will automatically process the dataset, provide a detailed overview, and generate visualizations that help you clearly see the patterns, distributions, and relationships hidden within your data.  

Instead of spending hours writing manual code or creating plots by hand, you can rely on the EDA Agent to instantly summarize the important features of your dataset, highlight missing values, give you a sense of how your variables are distributed, and even provide interactive graphs that allow you to visually explore the dataset in a much more intuitive way.  

To use the application, you simply need to click the **Upload File** button and select the CSV file that contains the data you want to analyze, and within a short time the system will automatically generate an overview of your dataset, create charts such as histograms, scatter plots, or heatmaps, and display them directly here in the interface so you can immediately dive into your analysis without any extra setup.  

Whether you are a beginner who just wants to get a better sense of what your dataset looks like or an experienced data scientist who needs a quick exploratory analysis before doing more advanced modeling, the **EDA Agent** gives you a simple, fast, and visually appealing way to start exploring and understanding your data with almost no effort.
